This WhatsApp integration processes messages sent to the connected WhatsApp number for the sole purpose of delivering automated responses and related functionality.

## Data we receive
- WhatsApp message content and metadata delivered via the WhatsApp Cloud API (e.g., phone numbers, message IDs, timestamps).
- Webhook delivery logs (HTTP status, timestamps, diagnostics).

## How we use the data
- To receive, process, and respond to WhatsApp messages.
- To debug delivery issues and improve reliability.

## Sharing
- We do not sell or share your WhatsApp data with third parties. Data is only sent to Meta’s WhatsApp Cloud API as required for messaging.

## Retention
- Messages and logs are retained only as long as needed for operation and troubleshooting, then deleted.

## Security
- Access to credentials and data is restricted to authorized operators. Transport uses HTTPS via the WhatsApp Cloud API and the configured webhook.

## Contact
- For questions or requests about your data, contact: oded.dubovsky@gmail.com
